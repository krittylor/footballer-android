    <string name="about_us">The New Yorker is a weekly magazine offering a signature mix of reporting and commentary on politics, international affairs, popular culture and the arts, science and technology, and business, along with fiction, poetry, humor, and cartoons. The magazine is available in print at newsstands and by subscription. We also publish each week’s full issue in an app for tablets and smartphones, available for download through the App Store, Google Play, or Amazon.

In addition, digital subscribers have access to our complete archive, which includes a digital replica of every issue of the print magazine, from 1925 to today. We also offer an E Ink edition for Kindle and Nook, editions through Zinio and Texture, and an audio edition of selected pieces from audible.com.

Our Web site, newyorker.com, features the full contents of each week’s magazine, plus everything we’ve published since 2007 and select older magazine stories. The site also publishes more than fifteen daily dispatches from New Yorker writers and artists, as well as podcasts, videos, slide shows, interactive graphics, and the Cartoon Caption Contest. All readers are able to enjoy the home page, the front page of each section, the video hub, Goings On About Town listings, and six articles per month at no charge before being asked to subscribe.

The Goings On app, a free guide to New York City culture from the staff of The New Yorker, is available from the App Store and Google Play.</string>
